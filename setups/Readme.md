This directory contains files that provide handcoded information to the robot:

* Grasps (how have I grasped objects)
* Object models (what is in my hands)
* Object features (edge, tip, etc.)

Ideally this should not be needed at all, because the robot should be able
to infer or recognize all such data about it's environment.
